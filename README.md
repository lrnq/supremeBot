# Outdated
This bot was one of the first things I wrote in Python back in the beginning of high school. It is super outdated and the Supreme shop has had many updates since then.  

# supremeBot
Use this bot at your own risk (Supreme may not accept orders from bots as of SS18, and might ban your ip). 
The bot can be used rather than you having to pay 100$ for one.
